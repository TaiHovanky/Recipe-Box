# Recipe-Box
Recipe Box project for freeCodeCamp using React

The Recipe Box lets users create recipes that have names and ingredients. The first view that a user sees is an index view where all of the names of the recipes are visible. Users can then click on those recipe names in order to view the ingredients. They can also click the Edit button to edit the ingredients listed for that recipe. If they change the name of the recipe, a new recipe is created. Recipes can be added or deleted.
